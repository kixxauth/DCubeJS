DCubeJS Release Notes
=====================

### Version 0.1 April 25th, 2010
--------------------------------

This is the initial release. Currently DCubeJS only works as a JavaScript
module on the Mozilla platform with `Components.utils.import()`. The
documentation and road map does not exist yet, so don't go looking for it.
